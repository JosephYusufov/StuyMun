               <span class="desc">
                    Since its inception in Summer 2018 by former Directors-General Ahmed Sultan and Ben Platt, miniMUNC
                    has primarily sought to deal with two issues — conference affordability, and a harsh, often
                    unforgiving learning
                    environment for new delegates looking to become involved.
                    <br><br>
                    Model UN is an activity which one can only truly improve through practice and experience; however,
                    many novice delegates
                    are
                    thrust into their first conference without adequate amounts of preparation, or a clear idea on how
                    to participate. New
                    delegates are often taken advantage of or exposed to bad situations in committees — because of this,
                    many MUN-hopefuls
                    stop participating after
                    their first experiences. Conference costs also prove to be a barrier, as some conferences simply
                    demand too high of a
                    price for individuals or school delegations to be able to afford.
                    <br> <br>
                    miniMUNC aims to work toward solving these issues. Stuyvesant's team, led by Directors-General Alma
                    Thaler and Julian
                    Bedolis, works to provide a unique, novice-friendly experience that can be enjoyed by all delegates,
                    all at an
                    affordable price. Delegates who attend miniMUNC will be able to participate in workshops, with
                    lessons curated by experienced
                    MUN members, and committees that have been specially designed to be fun for those of all levels of
                    experience — whether they be new to the MUN concept,
                    or a seasoned delegate. <br> <br>
                    We hope to see you there!

                         <span class="desc">The Romani have always been a people without a home. Once known as Gypsies,
                              the Roma are a diverse race with mysterious
                              origins who have faced persistent discrimination ever since they migrated to Europe
                              thousands of years ago. What began
                              as slander pegging the Roma as thieving crooks has since evolved into widespread systemic
                              discrimination which continues
                              to pervade much of Southern Europe to this day. In this committee, delegates will be
                              tasked with dismantling the age-old
                              hierarchy responsible for the oppression and persecution of the Roma. Any solution will
                              have to simultaneously
                              deescalate rising tensions and improve race relations in hopes of avoiding violence.
                              Through a series of negotiations
                              and debates, delegates will strive to give the Romani a home once and for all.</span>

                              resourceful and creative solutions to the dreadful Yemeni famine. The crisis in Yemen is

                              Yemeni Civil War, which put over 17 million civilians at risk. It’s up to delegates to
                              overcome decades or even
                              centuries of in-fighting to reach a just solution. We are excited to see delegates engage

                         <span class="desc">This year, the International Labour Organization will celebrate its 100th
                              anniversary, marking 100 years of work to
                              bring together governments, employers, and workers of 187 member states. Making use of a
                              tripartite governing structure
                              which consists of the General Conference, the Bureau of Workers’ Activities, and the
                              Bureau of Employers’ Activities,
                              the International Labour Organization works to set labor standards and develop policies
                              that protect all workers
                              regardless of race, gender, or religion. This year at MiniMUNC, we will be debating the
                              issue of labor rights in the
                              garment industry from the perspective of government delegates to the ILO. It’s no secret
                              that the trend of “fast
                              fashion” has led to many major clothing brands using unethical business practices in
                              factories and sweatshops all around
                              the world, driving prices down at the expense of worker safety and wages. We look forward
                              to having a fruitful discourse
                              about the best way to protect the rights of these vulnerable workers and address the
                              issues they face, from ensuring
                              fair wages and hours, to protecting their right to unionize, to protecting female emloyees
                              from sexual harassment and
                              pregnancy discrimination.

                              occurred in Chernobyl, Ukraine. In this committee
                              delegates will travel to the Soviet Union to join the Soviet Politburo, meeting to decide
                              on a course of action and
                              separate fact from fiction. As delegates, each committee member must grapple with the
                              collapsing structure of the Soviet
                              Union, increasing pressure from the rest of the world in the wake of the incident, and
                              surviving the clutches of the
                              shadowy KGB, all while saving the lives of their fellow comrades. The fate of the country
                              depends on the decisions made
                              here, and the sacrifices that will need to be made will irrevocably change the history of
                              the world. Watching HBO’s
                              Chernobyl and/or having a good understanding of the incident is highly recommended.
