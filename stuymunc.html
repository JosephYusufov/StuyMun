               <span class="desc">
                    Since its inception in Summer 2018 by former Directors-General Ahmed Sultan and Ben Platt, miniMUNC
                    has primarily sought to deal with two issues — conference affordability, and a harsh, often
                    unforgiving learning
                    environment for new delegates looking to become involved.
                    <br><br>
                    Model UN is an activity which one can only truly improve through practice and experience; however,
                    many novice delegates
                    are
                    thrust into their first conference without adequate amounts of preparation, or a clear idea on how
                    to participate. New
                    delegates are often taken advantage of or exposed to bad situations in committees — because of this,
                    many MUN-hopefuls
                    stop participating after
                    their first experiences. Conference costs also prove to be a barrier, as some conferences simply
                    demand too high of a
                    price for individuals or school delegations to be able to afford.
                    <br> <br>
                    miniMUNC aims to work toward solving these issues. Stuyvesant's team, led by Directors-General Alma
                    Thaler and Julian
                    Bedolis, works to provide a unique, novice-friendly experience that can be enjoyed by all delegates,
                    all at an
                    affordable price. Delegates who attend miniMUNC will be able to participate in workshops, with
                    lessons curated by experienced
                    MUN members, and committees that have been specially designed to be fun for those of all levels of
                    experience — whether they be new to the MUN concept,
                    or a seasoned delegate. <br> <br>
                    We hope to see you there!

                    <p>
                         Despite the landmark Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons treaty, for the last thirty years multiple nations have been
                         able to gain access to nuclear weapons. In particular, this has been caused by influences from first world nations.
                         Nuclear weapons are mostly possessed by first world countries, such as the USA, France, the UK, etc. Due to their
                         influence, more and more leaders around the world want to obtain nuclear weapons and technologies to create them. The
                         General Assembly should focus on trying to outline the regulations and policies which would solidify the role of first
                         world countries in the incentivization of nuclear weapons.

                    <p>
                         In this committee, delegates will discuss possible solutions to resolve the instability between the Colombian-Venezuelan
                         border which limits the opportunities of both countries’ refugees. Colombia and Venezuela have rich histories of
                         political instability, corruption and dangerous conflicts as well as a dynamic, ever-evolving relationship between the
                         two. Since Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro closed the Colombian-Venezuelan border in 2015, deporting Colombian
                         migrants, the situation has been quelled, and the borders reopened, but the volatility of the region continue to produce
                         refugees from both countries and an everlasting conflict.

                         Since 2010, UN Women has worked tirelessly to promote gender equality, confront discrimination, and create new
                         opportunities for women worldwide. This UN Women committee will focus on the more recent issue of online gender based
                         violence. Delegates will work to form resolutions that encompass the best ways to control the spread of female assault
                         online. This committee will mostly include delegates from more developed countries, as countries with limited access to
                         the internet will have yet to determine their stance on this issue.

                    <p>
                         The New York City Council is a unicameral legislative body that acts in the background to run the intricacies of the
                         city that never sleeps. It is tasked today with dictating the future of Rikers Island, the notorious main prison complex
                         of the city that has been scrutinized for its practices of neglect and heavy abuse towards its prisoners, many mentally
                         ill. It is time for the New York City Council to step in before the crisis in the prison escalates further. Considering
                         the limitations of the council and the New York City Budget, councilmembers will be expected to come out of this
                         committee with a viable solution to dealing with the controversial establishment. Let us not smear the reputation of the
                         Big Apple any further—good luck.

                    <p>
                         The War in Darfur, or the Land Cruiser War has been a long term conflict between the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) and
                         the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebel groups both attempting to reform and fight the government in Sudan for
                         oppressing Darfur’s (the Sudanese capital) non-Arab population. The government harshly responded to revolt through a
                         violent campaign of ethnic cleansing against non-Arabs resulting in deaths of hundreds of thousands of Sudanese citizens
                         under President Omar al-Bashir’s reign, regarded as some of the worst crimes against humanity by the International
                         Criminal Court. For this very reason, we request delegates to resolve the humanitarian and political crisis with respect
                         and maturity, as this crisis is a gruesome but overlooked one, that could potentially set precedents for future
                         humanitarian crises.

                    <p>
                         The 39th U.S. Senate is set in the wake of the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House and the passing
                         of the Thirteenth Ammendment, right before the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the subsequent ascension of Andrew
                         Johnson to presidency. While there will not be a set agenda, the general topic of discussion during this session will be
                         centered around the issue of Reconstruction, and how to improve the status of minorities in the states. Delegates
                         representing both Union and Confederate states will be responsible for working to readmit states into the Union,
                         debating civil rights legislature, and healing a divided nation after a divisive civil war.

                         The phrase “Small Island Developing States” (or SIDS) might conjure up images of pristine beaches and turquoise waters,
                         but in reality, each of these countries struggles against a unique set of challenges brought on by its specific social,
                         economic, and environmental context. As the world we know continues to advance and evolve, these fifty-seven countries
                         and territories face the threat of being left in the dust. In this committee, delegates will tackle the key to helping
                         these isolated societies thrive: envisioning a self-sustaining, environmentally friendly economic system for SIDS around
                         the world. From renewable energy to national exports, every aspect of the economy must be accounted for, all while
                         preserving the individual culture that makes each one of these island states such an integral part of our global
                         community.

                    <p>
                         The 2011-12 NBA season did not begin until Christmas Day, nearly two months after the originally scheduled opening. The
                         National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) could not agree on a new
                         Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), leading to a tense lockout filled with yelling matches, controversial Tweets,
                         fines, and high-profile lawsuits. The two sides argued over complex issues including the division of revenue and salary
                         cap, leading to a shortened season and the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. In this committee, representatives
                         from the NBA and NBPA will sit together and try to iron out their differences. The goal is to create a comprehensive CBA
                         that will satisfy them both, and they must do so as quickly as possible, with restless fans, players who could bolt
                         overseas, and big money on the line.

                         U.S. president are supplanted by a new power? Has Prohibition spelled doom for the bootleggers, or will the steady flow
                         of cash endure? Keep a watchful eye as the festivities begin at the Breakers Hotel, and remember: “A smile can get you
                         far, but a smile with a gun can get you further.”—Al Capone

                    <span class=type>The Watergate Scandal</span> <br> <br>
                    <p>
                         On June 17, 1972, three years into Nixon’s presidential term, five men accessed confidential documents in the Democratic
                         National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate Office Building. The Nixon administration, then entangled in the
                         controversial Vietnam War, had ample cause to steal files from the DNC in an effort to secure a second term. Even though
                         one of the burglars arrested has CIA connections, Nixon adamantly denied any connection to the burglary. The cabinet is
                         being called together just hours after the break-in in an endeavor to mitigate the spread of belief of the president’s
                         involvement in the unauthorized espionage. It is in the interest of each cabinet member to adhere to the requests of
                         Nixon while also upholding individual reputations: this balance between truth and compliance crucial in determining the
                         future of the oval office. Cabinet members must stay wary of whistleblowers and attentive to the rising public
                         speculation whilst also being prepared for significant updates and press interjections.

                         In this committee, delegates will have the daunting task of representing members of Hong Kong government as they face
                         the largest protests in Hong Kong’s history. They will need to take action to de-escalate tensions between protestors
                         and police, balance the interests of the mainland with the demands of the protestors, mitigate the disruption of school
                         and work currently facing Hong Kong, respond to the concerns of the international community, and find a solution that
                         brings peace back to the city in the most diplomatic way possible. The future of Hong Kong hangs in the balance, and
                         delegates will be expected to handle this sensitive issue in a serious, appropriate manner.

                    <p>
                         In 1982, United States v. AT&T closed with the ruling that the American Telephone and Telegraph Company Corporation
                         (AT&T Corp.) was required to relinquish control over the smaller operating companies (called Regional Bell Operating
                         Companies, or RBOCs), on grounds of violating antitrust laws. Effectively ending the de-facto telecommunications
                         monopoly AT&T and the Bell System, nine total new standalone companies—referred to informally as 'Baby Bells'—were
                         created in 1984 by the divestiture of AT&T. Delegates will be forced to act and innovate in a new era of
                         telecommunications, facing new technologies and pressure from international competitors. Who will survive? Who will
                         thrive?
