                        <center><b><p style="font-style: italic;">TOPIC B - TACKLING SECURITY CHALLENGES OF THE ARCTIC</p></b></center>

                          <p>The Cyprus conflict is commonly referred to as the "graveyard of diplomacy", and is widely considered a stalemate between two equally persistent parties, the Greeks and the Turks. The ethnic makeup of the island of the two primary groups, of which the former comprise the majority, has led to unrest and strife that since 1974, has resulted in the partition of the island into two portions. The Republic of Cyprus is the officially recognized entity, and is primarily Greek in makeup, while the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, obviously comprising of Turkish Cypriots, is the breakaway Turkish stronghold on an island now renowned for its political gridlock.</p>
  <p>The Arctic Ocean, also known as "the last frontier", is evolving into a geographical space of increasing importance and relevance in global politics, due to its growing viability as a valuable region as a result of climate change, that can be used to fuel global economies, but also taken as a matter of geopolitical contention. Since challenges posed by the opening of such an untouched area can prove volatile in sparking international conflict, such critical issues must be ironed out before the area can be used for global benefit.</p>

</p></b></center>

                        <p>For hundreds of years indigenous populations have been repeatedly marginalized by the global community. In this committee we aim to take a global perspective on how to tackle issues facing the indigenous communities. From poverty and access to job opportunities to expanding access to healthcare and reducing discrimination, this committee aims to come up with feasible solutions to these pressing issues.</p>
  <p>The issue of domestic violence has been a taboo for as long as the concept of partnership has existed. In this committee we are hoping to lift the veil on the horrible reality of domestic violence and arrive at practical solutions to help make the victims of domestic violence safer, as well as breaking taboos about speaking out against domestic abusers. We also aim to address what, if anything, this committee can do to create global frameworks to address issues such as reporting and punishing domestic abusers. We will also focus on defining what constitutes domestic violence, as well as the oft forgotten members of the LGBT+ community.</p>

  </p></b></center>

                        <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) was established on April 7, 1948 following the creation of the United Nations (UN) in 1945. The goals of providing leadership on emerging health issues, setting health-based norms and standards, conducting research, disseminating knowledge, using evidence and ethics in policy, providing technological support, and monitoring and assessing healthcare trends. In the seventy years that the WHO has existed, it has combated a wide variety of diseases with a myriad of healthcare initiatives and many major successes. In this committee’s session, the delegations of WHO will focus on addressing global infant mortality and the privatization of healthcare. The risk of a child dying before completing the first year of age in the WHO African Region is highest at a rate of 51 per 1000 live births. This committee will work on ameliorating this ongoing crisis. For our second topic, the WHO committee will debate on the ethicality of the privatization of healthcare. Healthcare privatization is not only an issue that affects first world countries, but is a developing discussion in the MENA area as well. </p>

                      <p>Only a few months into 2018, Saudi Arabia made the decision to begin phasing out its oil industry before the value of petroleum dropped - instead of turning to its country’s massive solar potential, though, they sought out the help of the United States in establishing a nuclear energy program. However, the nation refuses to outsource its nuclear fuel, opting instead to domestically enrich its uranium at a higher cost. This raises the question of whether, if allowed the facilities, this plan could be a smokescreen for further enrichment into weapons-grade uranium, and thereby an eventual nuclear arsenal. In this committee, you will be faced with the challenge of navigating the tense political balance between the countries with nuclear weaponry and those looking to seize hold of it, and determining how best to approach nuclear deals in the future.</p>

The delegates elected to this National Assembly must make a constitution articulating the role and form of the new government. This task has become extraordinarily difficult because of the multiple crises facing Germany in the post-war era: the painful economic hardships, largely caused by the Treaty of Versailles, have resulted in hyperinflation, debt, and less overall economic activity. Because of this economic and social anxiety, radical political groups on the far right and left, and radical communists attempting to overthrow the government have begun to crop up. Delegates must be prepared not only to create a functional government, but one that is sustainable in the face of political and economic turmoil. </p>
