      <h2>Committee Attendance</h2>
      <p>Delegates are expected to remain in their committees for both Committee Sessions I and Committee Sessions II. While delegates are allowed to leave committee for brief periods, they are prohibited from leaving the school building at any time. If a delegate for any reason must miss part of committee, please have the associated faculty advisor relay this information to the StuyMUNC Secretariat via email at <span class="email">stuymunc2020@gmail.com</span>.
Delegates may not leave the building during lunch. Food will be provided in the cafeteria, or delegates may bring a packed lunch from home.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Laptops, Smartphones, and Tablets</h2>
      <p>While electronic devices are extremely useful in research and fact-checking, not all delegates are equipped with the same devices and internet capabilities. For this reason,<span class="email"> electronic devices are expressly forbidden</span> from committee while in session. All committee documents (working papers, notes and speeches) must be received on paper, handwritten.
      </p>

      <h2>Position Papers</h2>
      <p>StuyMUNC greatly encourage pre-conference research. Position papers are strongly recommended, though <span class="email">not mandatory</span>. Should a delegate write a position paper, they will be guaranteed feedback if they submit it to their chairs via email by <span class="email">Friday, March 27th</span>.
      </p>

      <h2>Dress Code</h2>
      <p>Delegates are expected to wear Western business attire (WBA) for all committee sessions (closed-toed shoes, dress/dress shirt and skirt or slacks for those who wish to dress in traditional female attire and a dress shirt, tie and slacks for those wishing to dress in traditional male attire). In the case of a delegate being unable to obtain WBA, the Secretariat does mandate that a spirit of formality in both dress and behavior be maintained.
      </p>

      <h2>Nametags</h2>
      <p>To ensure safety, delegates must wear their nametags while at StuyMUNC. Should a delegate misplace their nametag, they may ask their dais or any StuyMUNC staff for a replacement.
      </p>

      <h2>Work Outside of Committe and Pre-Written Documents</h2>
      <p>Pre-written documents, including but not limited to: pre-written working papers in their entirety, pre-written operative or preambulatory clauses, pre-written notes, and pre-written directives, are expressly forbidden. However, pre-conference research and speech planning is not only allowed but highly encouraged. Delegates are encouraged to collaborate amongst themselves during the lunch break should they find time to do so.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Decorum</h2>
      <p>Decorum, defined as behavior in good taste, is expected throughout the StuyMUNC day. Any delegate known to have exhibited disruptive, harassing, or abusive behavior in or out of committee will have the guardian listed on their registration notified and may be dismissed from the conference at the Secretariat’s discretion. 
      </p>

      <h2>Loss of Belongings</h2>
      <p>StuyMUNC can not take responsibility for the loss of any personal belongings. However any delegate found stealing from another may be dismissed from the conference at the Secretariat’s discretion, and the guardian or faculty advisor noted on their registration will be notified.
      </p>

      <h2>Assault, Harassment, and Discrimination</h2>
      <p>Any conference participant (be they delegate, conference staffer or dais member) found to have harassed, assaulted or discriminated against a conference participant or school official will be immediately dismissed from the conference at the discretion of the  Secretariat, and the guardian noted on their registration will be notified. Reports of misconduct may be made in the form of a note to the dais. Should a delegate prefer a different route of reporting misconduct (harassment, assault or discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, age, or disability), they may email stuymunc2020@gmail.com.
