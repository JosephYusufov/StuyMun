                Welcome!
                <br><br>
                The Stuyvesant Model UN Delegation is extremely proud to present our newest iteration of StuyMUNC, StuyMUNC 2020.
                Following our novice-centered miniMUNC, our focus shifts to StuyMUNC. One of the premier high school Model UN
                experiences for delegates across the Tri-State area, StuyMUNC is well known for its enthralling crises and unique
                committees. Our dedicated daises have spent months meticulously constructing their committees, and we take pride in
                their thorough preparation.
                <br><br>
                This year's StuyMUNC will be held on Saturday, April 4th, 2020, at Stuyvesant High School in Tribeca. If you would
                like to contact our team please feel free to reach out to us at stuymunc2020@gmail.com. We look forward to hosting your
                delegation this spring!

            <span class="desc">The Stuyvesant Model United Nations team, more commonly known as StuyMUN, is a nationally ranked team made up of students from Stuyvesant High School in
            New York, NY. Throughout the course of the academic year, members develop skills in writing, public speaking, and communication while competing both locally and nationally in 
            some of the nation's most prestigious high school and collegiate institutions. <br> <br>In addition to these competitions, StuyMUN members also work toward hosting StuyMUNC,
            a conference held every April that invites students and high school delegations from all around the Greater New York City area. Recently, the team has also begun hosting miniMUNC, a training
            conference held every fall that aims to provide a learning environment for novice delegates and those wishing to hone their skills. <br> <br> <br></span>
