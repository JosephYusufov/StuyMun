                <span class="desc">Since its inception in Summer 2018 by former Directors-General Ahmed Sultan and Ben Platt, miniMUNC
                    has primarily sought to deal with two issues — conference affordability, and a harsh, often unforgiving learning environment for new delegates looking to become involved.
                    <br><br>
                    Model UN is an activity which one can only truly improve through practice and experience; however, many novice delegates are
                    thrust into their first conference without adequate amounts of preparation, or a clear idea on how to participate. New delegates are often taken advantage of or exposed to bad situations in committees — because of this, many MUN-hopefuls stop participating after
                    their first experiences. Conference costs also prove to be a barrier, as some conferences simply demand too high of a price for individuals or school delegations to be able to afford.
                    <br> <br>
                    miniMUNC aims to work toward solving these issues. Stuyvesant's team, led by Directors-General Alma Thaler and Julian Bedolis, works to provide a unique, novice-friendly experience that can be enjoyed by all delegates, all at an affordable price.

            <span class="desc">The Stuyvesant Model United Nations team, more commonly known as StuyMUN, is a nationally ranked team made up of students from Stuyvesant High School in
            New York, NY. Throughout the course of the academic year, members develop skills in writing, public speaking, and communication while competing both locally and nationally in 
            some of the nation's most prestigious high school and collegiate institutions. <br> <br>In addition to these competitions, StuyMUN members also work toward hosting StuyMUNC,
            a conference held every April that invites students and high school delegations from all around the Greater New York City area. Recently, the team has also begun hosting miniMUNC, a training
            conference held every fall that aims to provide a learning environment for novice delegates and those wishing to hone their skills. <br> <br> <br></span>
